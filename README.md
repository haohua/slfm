Sparse Latent Factor Model

slfm is a set of tools to fit sparse latent factor models to microarray data. This includes functions to:

  * pre-process a set of matrices
  * fit models to a set of matrices
  * detailed summary of model fit

Considerable effort has been put into making slfm fast and memory efficient, so as slfm is an attractive alternative to simpler methods in terms of execution time.
