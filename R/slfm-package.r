#' slfm: the sparse latent factor model package for R.
#'
#' slfm is a set of tools to fit sparse latent factor models to microarray data. This includes
#' functions to:
#' 
#'   * pre-process a set of matrices
#'   * fit models to a set of matrices
#'   * detailed summary of model fit
#' 
#' Considerable effort has been put into making slfm fast and memory efficient, so as slfm is an
#' attractive alternative to simpler methods in terms of execution time.
