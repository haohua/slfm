Title: Tools for Fitting Sparse Latent Factor Model
Version: 0.2
Author: Joao Duarte and Vinicius Mayrink
Maintainer: Joao Duarte <jdanielnd@gmail.com>
Description: Set of tools to find coherent patterns in microarray data
    using a Bayesian sparse latent factor model. Considerable effort has
    been put into making slfm fast and memory efficient, turning it an
    interesting alternative to simpler methods in terms of execution time.
    It implements versions of the SLFM using both type of mixtures: using
    a degenerate distribution or a very concentrated normal distribution
    for the spike part of the mixture. It also implements additional
    functions to help pre-process the data and fit the model for a large
    number of arrays.
